        <blockquote cite="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Harry_Potter">
          <p>
            "I see Harry as someone who is struggling to do the right thing, who
            is not without faults, who acts impetuously as you would expect
            someone of his age to act, but who is ultimately a very loyal
            person, and a very very courageous person. So, in as much as he has
            qualities that I admire most I would say he is a good role model.
            That doesn't mean that he is saintly, but then frankly, who is? But
            I think you do see enough of Harry's inner life, the workings of his
            mind in the books to know that he is ultimately human, struggling to
            do the right thing, which I think is admirable."
